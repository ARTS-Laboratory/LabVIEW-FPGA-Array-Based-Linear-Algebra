# Python code for Jacobi Eigenvalue algorithm 

## Python 2D code
1. v1 is close to the original code from 2019, I cleaned it up a bit and made it for a normal matrix problem, not for a modal analysis problem. 
1. v2 Convert the C matrix to an A matrix. 
1. Removing the temp values in the three for loops needs the temp value in the second part or the value will change. 

## Python 1D code
1. v1 is the original 1D code from 2019.
1. v2 cleans up some naming conventions.
1. v3 updates v2 as v2 was not returning the correct values. Removing the temp values in the three for loops needs the temp value in the second part or the value will change. This code has lots of break points, but works in combination with labVIEW v2. Changed to v5 to work with LabVIEW v3. 



## MATLAB code
1. This is just a sanity check to see how MATLAB returns the eigenvalues of the troubleshooting matrix.
